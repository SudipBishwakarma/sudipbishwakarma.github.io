"Khulla Akash" is a Nepali pop-rock song that I composed, arranged, performed, recorded, and produced for Karma Records in Kathmandu, Nepal. The song is in the key of E major and features a 4/4 time signature throughout most of the track, with a 6/8 time signature used in the pre-chorus.

The track features a rich instrumental arrangement, including acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass, piano, synth keys, tambourine, and drums. It begins with a recurring melody played on the acoustic guitar, supported by tambourine and drums accenting key beats. The song's lyrical content conveys a happy and uplifting feeling, which is mirrored in its upbeat tempo and major key. I personally recorded the acoustic and electric guitar parts, including the solo sections. I used Guitar Pro to program bass, piano, and drum tracks and exported the MIDI files to a Pro Tools session. For the drum track, I used Addictive Drums, and similar plugins for the piano and bass tracks.</p>

To add a dynamic rhythmic element, I experimented with mixed meters in this song. The pre-chorus section transitions to a 6/8 time signature, creating a rhythmic contrast, before returning to 4/4 for the rest of the track. The song was released on YouTube and other music streaming platforms in 2016, where it became another hit among Nepali music lovers. This was the fourth single I produced for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTeLNwXHsuY" target="_blank">Karma Records</a>.</p>
<p>
A standout feature of this track is the interplay between acoustic and electric guitar solos, designed to feel like a musical conversation. The electric guitar initiates the solo, which is then answered by the acoustic guitar. Creating this back-and-forth dialogue was both a fun and challenging part of the production process.
