"Ae Hello" is a Nepali pop song that I arranged, performed, recorded, and produced for Karma Records in Kathmandu, Nepal. The song is in the key of F# major and follows a 4/4 time signature.

The track features instruments such as acoustic guitar, piano, synth keys, and Glockenspiel. It begins with a delicate acoustic guitar plucking pattern, accompanied by a second acoustic guitar playing a recurring melody and harmony. This is followed by the piano and synth keys, which add depth and texture to the arrangement. The build-up before the guitar solo incorporates a syncopated Glockenspiel melody and staccato synth orchestra, enriching the song's dynamic progression.

At 2:32, the piano emphasizes a note to align with the lyrical context of the song. Similarly, from 2:47 to 2:49, the piano accentuates the lyrics referencing a lullaby, enhancing the emotional impact of the moment. The song was released on YouTube and other music streaming platforms in 2016, becoming a hit among Nepali music lovers. It was the third single I produced for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP_B7KuG7fc" target="_blank">Karma Records</a>.

An interesting aspect of the recording process involved crafting the guitar rhythm to emulate Ed Sheeranâ€™s signature style. To achieve this, I muted the strings while strumming to produce a percussive, distinct sound reminiscent of his music. Recording this part was challenging and required over 500 takes. I experimented extensively, not only with playing techniques but also with recording methods. For the neck and middle positions of the guitar, I used a condenser microphone, while for the bridge position, capturing the percussive muted strums, I opted for a cardioid microphone.
