This is a cover arrangement of the popular Nepali pop song "Parelima" by the band 1974 AD. Originally released in 1998, the song has become a classic in the Nepali music scene.

As a fan of the band and the song, I decided to create my own version, staying true to its original essence while infusing it with my personal style. The arrangement features an acoustic rendition, incorporating acoustic guitar, cajon, and background vocal harmonies. I performed and recorded all the instrumental parts myself, except for the cajon. For the background vocal harmonies, I recorded my own voice.

The vocalist featured in the video is Swoopna Suman, now a popular Nepali singer, for whom I produced both covers and original music during my tenure at Karma Records. In this cover, I added my own improvisations to the guitar solo and introduced unique fills throughout the song.

Upon its release in 2015, the video was well-received online. Notably, Phiroj Shyangden, the lead singer of 1974 AD, praised my guitar-playing skills and expressed his appreciation for my rendition of the song.
