I transcribed the original song and added my own variations to create a piano arrangement for a freelancing project, which I later re-adapted for a studio cover.

I used Finale Music Notation software for the transcription and arrangement, adding variations to emphasize the vocal melody in the cover version. To bring out the dynamics, I included different articulations and pedal markings. After exporting the MIDI file, I imported it into a Pro Tools session, transposed it a half step down to match the singerâ€™s range, and used Addictive Keys for the piano sound.

This was the first cover arrangement I did for Karma Records.
