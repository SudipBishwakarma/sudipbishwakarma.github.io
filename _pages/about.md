Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a musician turned software engineer with a Masterâ€™s in Information Technology from [London Metropolitan University](https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/), currently seeking a graduate program to build research skills in machine learning by combining NLP and music technology.

With over 9 years of experience in Big Data and eCommerce, I have developed and deployed scalable systems with expertise in cloud computing, distributed systems, data streaming, and data pipelines. Currently, I am leading a team to design real-time data mastering and retrieval [\(MDM\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management) solutions focused on U.S. healthcare data for [Cotiviti](https://www.cotiviti.com/) at [Infinite](https://www.infinite.com/). In addition to my full-time role, I am a part-time instructor at [Islington College](https://www.islington.edu.np/), where I teach undergraduate students about software development and shipping. I also work with startups and small businesses as a consultant, helping them integrate Generative AI into their workflows.

Before my software engineering career, I was a freelance musician, and arranger for [Karma Records](https://www.youtube.com/@KarmaRecordsNepal), a Kathmandu-based record label, where I collaborated with professional musicians and cover artists.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing sports with friends, staying up-to-date on academia and tech via X, refining my guitar skills, and occasionally sharing videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SudipBishwakarma). With a unique journey from music production to Big Data engineering, I am eager to leverage my diverse expertise to advance research in machine learning, combining NLP and music technology to bridge art and data-driven innovation.
