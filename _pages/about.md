Hi! 👋

I'm a musician turned software engineer with a strong focus on advancing my research skills, particularly in machine learning and music technology, through a graduate program. I earned a Master’s degree with focus in Data Analytics from [London Metropolitan University](https://www.londonmet.ac.uk/).

With over 8 years of experience in Big Data and eCommerce, I’ve developed and deployed scalable systems with a specialization in cloud computing, distributed systems, data streaming, and pipelines. Currently, I’m focused on Big Data analytics, designing real-time data mastering and retrieval solutions for U.S. healthcare data at [Infinite](https://www.infinite.com/). Besides my full-time job, I’m also a part-time instructor at [Islington College](https://www.islington.edu.np/), where I teach undergraduate students about software development and shipping. Additionally, I work with startups and small businesses as a consultant helping them embrace Generative AI to their current workflows.

Before my software engineering career, I was a freelance musician and arranger for [Karma Records](https://www.youtube.com/@KarmaRecordsNepal), a Kathmandu-based label, where I collaborated with professional musicians and cover artists.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing sports with friends, staying up-to-date on academia through X, and refining my guitar skills. I’m excited about blending my background in music with cutting-edge research in machine learning and music technology, aiming to make impactful contributions to these fields.
