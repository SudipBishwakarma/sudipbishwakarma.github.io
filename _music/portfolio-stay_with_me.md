Inspired by the original song, I created an acoustic guitar arrangement of Sam Smith's "Stay With Me". In this arrangement, I incorporated a percussive fingerstyle technique to emulate the rhythm and dynamics of the song. The arrangement features a combination of chords, melody, and percussive elements to create a full sound on a single guitar. I performed and recorded the arrangement myself for a studio cover.

I used Guitar Pro software to notate the arrangement, adding fingerstyle patterns and percussive elements to enhance the overall performance. This arrangement is completely different sound-wise from the original song, as it focuses on the acoustic guitar's tonal qualities and rhythmic elements. It is arranged in the key of Bb major, a whole step down from the original key of C major, with a slightly faster tempo of 86bpm compared to the original 84bpm. After finalizing the notation, I recorded the arrangement in a studio using a condenser microphone to capture the acoustic guitar sound.

This was one of several cover arrangements I created for Karma Records.
